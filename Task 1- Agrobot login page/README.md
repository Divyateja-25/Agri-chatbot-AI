# Agri-chatbot-AI
AI-AgroBot is a Flask web app for farmers. Its multilingual chatbot uses a hybrid model, checking a local Knowledge Base (CSV/JSON) before falling back to OpenAI. It includes user registration/login and a secure admin dashboard for managing users, viewing chat history, and updating the bot's knowledge.
